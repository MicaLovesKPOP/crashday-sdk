  Welcome to the software development kit for Crashday: <span color="darkred" Redline Edition</span>.<br>
  Since the redline update a lot of things has changed in Crashday SDK and in the process of making mods. This section of the SDK will be targeted to help with the new version's features as well as revise some of the olds ones.
  Most of the <a href="../old-sdk/index.html">old sdk</a> should still be applicable, except some rare cases.
